# 🎲 Odd One Out

**A fun and engaging multiplayer game where players find the odd one out!**

## 📌 About

_Odd One Out_ is a React Native-powered game inspired by the concept of group dynamics. In each round, players are presented with a question or statement, and must choose the answer they believe most of the group would answer.
